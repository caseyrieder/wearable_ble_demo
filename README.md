# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

- If you do not have npm installed, follow installation instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have npm installed:

1. Download or clone the repo
2. In Terminal or Console, navigate the to project folder (XXX/XXX/XXX/wearable_ble_demo/)
3. Run "npm install"
4. Once that completes, run "npm start react-native"
   This ^ should start the Metro Bundler running. Do not close that tab in the Terminal/Console

To run the app on a device, refer to the React Native guide at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device
